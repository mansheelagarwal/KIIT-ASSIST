What's the present scenario of placements in KIIT?,"First of all, I would like to mention, you will get good placements only if you work hard - be it any college IIT or NIT or KIIT. Companies do not look at your college, it looks for the quality in you. Even some IITians do not get a job. It all depends on you how you can prepare yourself.

Now, once you acquire the required skill sets needed for the companies, the fact that matters is - Are you getting enough opportunities to prove your talent to the companies?

For this KIIT says yes. There are a huge number of companies offering 2LPA - 30LPA or more in some years. You can check out the highest package every year on the KIIT website.

Companies like (which I have seen) :

Amazon
VMWare
SAP
Nutanix
Morgan Stanley
BIJU’s
Dell
HP
FICO
Autodesk, many others ( I have listed only 10 of them )
These are so many of them other than the mass recruiters whose pay scale is really high. Many people do get their dream package.

The highlight for KIIT is -

You get explicit training from the T&P department for the placements and they are ready to help you as well. This does not happen in IITs.
The teachers there also try and help students get placed in the companies not only through on campus but also off-campus(for those companies that do not visit KIIT).
KIIT provides all the facilities for a student which even an IIT lacks such as quality teaching and the whole system.
I have friends in IITs that's why I am able to say all these.

So, why is KIIT not equivalent to any IIT as of now?

This is because, among the students who come to KIIT, most of them do not study. They just waste their time playing games, stalking girls, roaming around and sleeping. These people waste their time and end up in mass recruiting companies which pay in the range of 2–4 LPA. That's not worth it after paying such an amount of fees. But people who remain serious about their life from the beginning end up bagging packages more than 10 LPA.

For students in KIIT who are serious about their life, the average package is 10LPA for them.

The conclusion is KIIT is a great college for placements that can give you enough opportunities almost equivalent to IITs or NITs ( there are only a few companies that do not visit KIIT but visits in NIT or IIT). Now it's on you whether you can develop the skills or not. In both places, you will need skills for getting the job and no college can develop skills in you, it's you who have to work on yourself.",Placement
How is KIIT University for CSE?,"See bro many may not agree with my statement but these days private ones provide better exposure to students than government colleges(except top NIT’s and the 6 old IIT’s, others are shit). And these colleges don’t get their reputation to that level because of their management quota, but those who have done well in their entrance examinations for these private colleges get great package and learn a lot.

Next thing is that in any college these days, students from CSE get the most profit in almost each arena. So if you are getting CSE in private colleges like SRM,KIIT,MANIPAL,THAPAR…etc then you should obviously go for it.

In KIIT the only prblm i have heard mostly is that there mostly only students from eastern region come to study. Ofc they are good in studies but variety is always favored.

I know a senior of mine who got 160 in JEE MAINS 2017 but rather than joining any random branch in a decent NIT he decided it better to join CSE in one of these private colleges. They charge you heavy in caparison to government colleges(not much if you perform good in their entrance tests),but the facilities they provide you are worth it.

So finally i would say you should obviously go for it. Also its not so easy to get CSE in private also through their entrance exams. Its different if you opt for management quota.

Hope it helps.",Academics

How is life at the KIIT University in detail?,"First Year !

1. ) Focus on Grades: Ultimately this is the one thing that will help you to land a good job. To add more, if you have somehow fallen into the wrong department because of your ranks, grades will help you change your Branch.
Study smart and efficient, spend some time making friends, get acquainted with the atmosphere.
The ideal situation, if you are a studious guy, can be browsing internet, learning basic things that you missed during your 12th class. Browse some good topics from Khan Academy, TED Talks, explore opportunities available online, learn how to make good resume.

Try - http://bajatutor.org/noexcuselist/

2). Seek opportunities: I am saying seek, not look for that means if you are good in something and you are getting chance to exhibit it, then do it, but don't try those useless effort wasting your time, if that's not your cup of tea, there are still 3 more years to showcase hobbies or say extra academic activities.

3). Plan for next 4 years : You may be planning for MBA, MS, M. Tech. , GATE Exam, CDS, Defence, Civil Services, Politics, getting a good job or starting something of your own. Plan it this year only. This will help you to assimilate with those who matches your frequency. (I didn't mention Singer, writer, player because that is something called extra, anyhow you need to keep a PLAN B)

4). Do one Skill based Training : During vacation, go for developing your skill, if you are a mechanical & Automotive engineer try any one of these - CATIA, ANSYS, ADAMS, PRO-E, MATLAB, CAR SIM, get your hands dirty with some automotive repair works. For CSE, you can try - HTML, PHP, WordPress, JAVA, C, C#, Android Application Development. For Civil - you can try AutoCAD, and other structural design engineering software's, similarly Electrical & Electronics guys can opt for Circuitry designing, Arduino and some machine learning. In general you can try ADOBE (Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, After Effects), learn making good PPT's, working in Excel.

Solve some social problems or stuffs in daily uses, if not completed here in college, you can plan for later years.",Academics
How is the Fresher's Party in KIIT?,"Well, last year I attended the Freshers party and contrary to what you have seen in the previous answers its not as fun as anyone would think . Freshers party is the first party any one gets since they enter the college so the seniors should try to make it the best but instead they start preparing one week before the event. because of which the performance turns out to be average. There are performances like singing in which singer starts singing Bengali song in the middle and most students have no idea whats going on and the Bengalis would start shouting like Mamata Banerjee just appeared on the stage , stand up comedy by second year students in which they try to make audience laugh by making boyfriend-girlfriend jokes(silly) because they don’t know anything else , then there is regional dance (but, who the hell wanna see regional dance on freshers party) , there is other dance performance by the seniors which is fine considering the limited time they got for the preparation. The venue is the most interesting thing in all of this , its a open field which is covered using pandal ( I mean seriously is this a freshers party or wedding reception party) . Well it is hell for the boys as they have to shave completely (seriously, nothing you will see in the fresher will be worth it).

well lets calm down.

lets start again. Lets talk about exactly how its gonna be from start to the end .

First of all you will hear an announcement few days before that your dress code will be formal and you have to come clean shaved. Well no one love shaving their beard so there will be sad faces all around the hostel.

Then the night before the fresher everybody will start getting ready by trimming their beards. amen . Everyone will be crying inside but laughing outside by making fun of others calling them “mauga “.

Next day , you wake up lining in front of the toilets for you turn to shower. Then you get ready in your formals and while you are getting ready you hear a loud announcement in a very harsh voice saying “everybody come down bus is waiting for you “.

Then you climb down all the stairs and moving to the reception only to see that there are two guys with trimmers in their hands waiting to trim down any beard they can see on your face.

Then you take your seat on the bus , get to the venue, walk some distance to the pandal take your seat expecting to see your girl classmates but that dream also didnt come true beacause they are sitting way far from you.

Then you will get the breakfast packet containing some snacks which will remind you of the independance day celebration in your school.

Then you sit there for 6–7 hrs trying to enjoy the performances , then you will be taken for your lunch which is over hyped by the way as it is not so tasty as you will think .

Now, how can you make the most out of it. Here is something you can do:

stick to your group always try to stick to your group , this way you can do a lot more fun.
Keep an eye out for senior girls cause they are the real catch there. But don’t get caught in staring them cause there can be some senior boys trying to become hero by shouting at you and few more seniors join and it can get pretty ugly.
can occasionally dance in the middle of a performance.
take some photos #freshers #KIIT#fun….
Freshers is just the beginning many fests will follow after that . Buy tickets to all of them as fests are fun , you get DJ nights which is amazing and there is not so much restriction ..",Event
What is average package for CSE in KIIT?,"I from the 2022 graduating batch in KIIT and I feel I could answer the question. Do read the full post.The average package is around 4–5 LPA which is due to the mass recruiters. The mass recruiters hire a huge number of people who are not able to crack good companies. If you study well, there will be many high-end companies waiting for you at KIIT.There will be a number of companies offering you 6LPA - 30 LPA or even more. The main thing is you will get opportunities almost equivalent to any IITs or NITs. Students there, are more studious and more people are able to crack high-end companies which increase the average package for IITs and NITs.It's not at all about the average salary, it's just about the chance to sit for high-end companies and in KIIT you will get it. If are not able to crack them here, you won't be able to crack them in any other college also.

What is the placement scenario like for the ETC branch in KIIT?,"This correct answer is in Indian context:

KIIT is a fraud private Indian engineering college because all such colleges force their engineering students to not to gain the industry relevant skills by not offering them, these facilities, which increases the probability of any Indian engineering college producing highly skilled professionals for the industry.
Indian education mafia does this because if the graduate from any ordinary Indian engineering college starts getting skilled and starts earning money like the IITians do then it would kill the engineering entrance exam coaching industry.
Most of the degree holders from such colleges are shifted as clerks in the services based companies owned by the college owners. 3–4 LPA.

Choose any nearer shop than this shop.

Since Indian engineering curriculum is 40 years old hence NO Indian engineering college produces any skilled-employable ETC engineers and this is the reason that there are NO core private ETC companies in India.

Please note that there is a difference between telecom companies(Jio, Airtel, Voda fone etc) and electronics and telecommunication companies(Verizon, Huawei, Ericsson, Alcatel etc).

But it will be cross-checked by the respective faculties, as some of them maintain their own attendance sheet they will find that your attendance is marked(because of biometric attendance) but you are not in the class, they will mark you absent.

How is the quality of the food in KIIT university?,"I have eaten at most of the boys' hostels and have observed that it varies. It depends on your caterers. The food served in my hostel wasn't good at all. Rotis were served half cooked, vegetables were tasteless and dal was extremely dilute. In my opinion, it was the worst aspect of the college. On the contrary, the food served in other hostels was comparatively better. Maybe that was because the caterers there were better, or maybe the boarders went on frequent strikes against the food served. I'm a vegetarian, so I really can't comment on the quality of chicken served.
Initially you might like it, but as the days pass the quality degrades, and you guys have to make sure that you revolt against the same when it becomes un-eatable. That way, the authorities might change the caterers and through such vigilance the mess workers might be forced to prepare the food properly.

Is KIIT a good college in terms of education and faculty?,"EDUCATION

Soo, like every other Btech college they follow the same teaching pattern. White board classes with support of ppts and animations sometimes,

KIIT provides you with hard copy of required books every sem. But honestly no body uses them. They also have a set day wise lesson plan with the content of the subject and when it will be covered in the class.

Considering the current pandamic situation..online classes are not much effective but still comparing to other institutions they are trying best to provide tech. support for the same.They also have a tutor mentor support system.(In this a batch of around 30–35 students is assigned with a tutor mentor who is like a local guardian and will be the first one to help you in case of any prob. ) Time table for every sem , teacher selection after 1st year , organizing meetings with dean and subject Co-ordinators are some other perks provided to kiitians.

There is a huge library with almost all the books present that one needs, hostels have a reading rooms ( a room where student can go and study without distractions ). Overall a good atmosphere is provided .

FACULTY

Majorly all the prof. ,Ass. Prof , TAs , Lab staff members are all well educated and helping. Faculty members always appretiate students coming up with questions and show keen interest in solving their doubts.

BUT , large strength of batch is a bane , one to one interaction is not possible. Soo, students who put in their efforts to go and talk to the teachers, clear doubts are always welcomed even after the class or in break ..",Academics
How are the KIIT faculty?,"I’m 2017 passout ECE student. So, I can tell you how exactly faculties are there in electronics department of KIIT University .

First of all I’d like to suggest you to go for self-learning. NPTEL tutorials and books can be your best teacher.

Now, If I talk about teachers there, few of them are the best you can have. But, at the same time few of them enters classroom just for formality.

Few of the faculties will teach you what the subject is and will guide you perfectly but few of them will just teach you what you will get on question paper.

But, don’t get disheartened. Everyone has something good in them. Try to acquire it from them.

Rather checking how good your faculty is, check how good a learner you are. The more you will cultivate a habbit of self-learning, the more is the chances of your success in future.",Academics
Are mess fees included in hostel fees at KIIT?,"No….mess fees is not included in hostel fees..

Mess fees is 15000/semester..",Housing
How is the IT branch at KIIT?,"IT branch in KIIT is quiet good. As CSE and IT are the ones who are always ahead from other branches in terms of placement. You will get good subjects but on the contrary very few good teachers(which happens mostly in every college). Most of the time you need to try by yourself to understand a particular subject or concept. Opting this branch will offer you a good path to walk on, in terms of current technologies and coding. So, if you are really interested in IT stuffs then you can go on with this.",Academics
What should I carry with me after joining the KIIT University hostel?,"When I joined, I had the same question in my head.(every freshman does..duh!!).

However, some of the important things you should definitely bring with you are:-

A rope for drying clothes(if your roommates don’t have one). Also bring clips to secure the wet clothes in position.(NOTE: This point is applicable if you decide to wash your clothes yourself).
Your personal items like brush,toothpaste and all that stuff.
Always bring and keep yourself stocked with snacks.
Bring your Lab Coats if you have one(your chemistry lab coats from your high school). If you don’t have one, you can certainly purchase one from stores around the university.
Bring at least two towels(Trust me on this one).
Bring a tray to keep your personal belongings at bay. You can keep your toothbrush, toothpaste,comb,hair gel etc. in the tray. This will ensure that all your stuff is at one place and you will not lose them.
Bring a pen stand.
Bring at least five sets of inner wears.
Buy a pair of formal shoes(and socks obviously!).
Bring hangers to hang your clothes inside the wardrobe.
Bring at least two water bottles(Trust me, it gets really hot during the noon).
Bring a Lock(To secure your wardrobe).
The above listed things are stated from experience.

Notebooks and other stationery can be bought from stores around the campus.

If you need like breakfast cereals and stuff, there is BIGBAZAR close by the university and you can go there to fulfill your needs.

Things you should not bring(YES).

A bucket,mug. These will be provided at the hostel (if you are a hostel boarder).
Bed sheets, Blanket, pillow covers. You will be provided with these during entering you respective hostel.If you have your favorite pillow cases,bed sheets, you can bring them.
If you want, you can bring a table lamp but in most cases this wouldn’t be necessary as there is a reading room in every hostel which will open for 24 hours.",Housing
What is the timing of classes in KIIT?,"When i joined KIIT , In 1st year we had classes from 11 A.M to 5 P.M with 1 hour lunch break
However since last year we have classes from 8 A.M to 2 P.M(3 days) and 8–5(2 days) with no classes on Saturdays and Sundays.

Timings may change but Most probably this year also we will have 8–5",Academics
How does a CGPA matter during KIIT placement?,"I’m a part of the vast corporate world for 3 years now, also I have a lot friends who have the same experience in life. Let me tell you something important something that I have learnt after a lot of struggle, marks and CGPA does not matter, what matters is what you know and how you deliver. Your skills will matter, your attitude will matter, not the percentage of marks you get in an exam. Who knows next time you take the same exam you might score more or less that what you previously acquired.

Being said that, lets get down to business.

Consulting and Analytical companies, like MuSigma, EY & Deloitte, have no such policy as to judge candidates based on how much they have scored. They rely on their own hiring policies and practices to evaluate any campus hire. But you might need some minimum CGPA to get short-listed.

Investment Banks like JPMC, MorganStanley, DBS, ANZ don’t care about your academics as long as you’re good technically and analytically. But these companies wont be visiting KIIT campus as they recruit fresher only from top colleges. Although you can apply after you have gained some experience working in the industry.

Software Product companies like Siemens, Oracle, MS, Intel, Qualcomm do give some importance to CGPA, they usually go for 7.5 and above.

And as you’ve said you already know about service based companies like TCS, Infy, CTS, Capgemini etc. You’re already covered there.

Also, my advice go ask TnP for better clarifications, as it has been sometime since I’ve graduated, time and tide changes.",Academics
How is KIIT fest different from other events held in KIIT university?,"1.The fest consists for several competitive events like Open Sesame, Tell A Tale, Does Grey Matter?

2.This help to enhance your CV and to enjoy fully.

3.Chance to meet celebs like Asking,Chetan Bhagat,Armaan Mallick,Sanu Nigam,etc",Event
Does KIIT Entrepreneurship Cell organize any event at the university?,"Well don’t know if I am an antique piece to answer this as I am 04–08 B.Tech CSE batch , almost a decade since I passed out but really feel proud to see this turn around @KIIT which has happened , entrepreneurship cells , promoting start ups and what not .

To answer your question obviously it would have to be some one much younger than me to answer it correctly but I had attended the Alumni meet at Bangalore recently and got to know that there are number of events being conducted with regards to entrepreneurship .",Event
How can I get into KIIT bands or any singing event in KIIT?,"Go to KSAC,
Get in touch with seniors,
Follow some of the events so that you will be able to know who is into these departments whom you can contact.
Join KORUS society and you are set to go.",Event
KIIT E-Cell is organizing the NASA Space Apps hackathon in our college. Shall it be a good event or just a fad/crappy event like most college hackathons?,"So if these projects do not look amazing and bore you to death , then yes , this hackathon shall be boring/crappy for you . If not, well why wait ? If you win here and make it to the national level finals that shall be hosted in Delhi and win there , well you shall receive incubation from the NASA space apps accelerator along with a big fat cheque to enjoy.

KIIT E-Cell is organizing the NASA Space apps Hackathon on the 17th of August , 2019 and this is happening for the first time in Odisha. Log on to ecell.org.in/nasa to get further details.

We have limited seats, so register soon and , Best of Luck !",Event
Does being in societies or co-curricular activities help in getting placements in KIIT?,"I have been into organizing a lot of events in KIIT thus making me good enough to answer this question of yours.

Yes, it helps.

Now before people go berserk claiming that it doesn’t, let me clarify the reason of my statement.

When you are involved in any co curricular activity you get a lot more exposure than just sitting there in your room. I will talk about myself. During the first two years of my college life, I used to stay away from all the college events and societies. It was only in my third year that I joined the quizzing society of the college and that was the turning point of my entire college life.

When you are a part of a society, you get to develop a lot more skills, some of which I will mention down for you

Team Work: The first thing I learnt being a part of Qutopia is that you need a team to make anything success. You may find pleasure in working alone but working in a team together increases your chances of success exponentially. It is always the team before individual.
Patience: Ask any one involved in events in KIIT, one thing they would all say in unison is that you need a lot of patience if you want to organize an event. I would not go into the details for that, but yes, patience is a key factor.
Confidence: Trust me when I say that co-curricular activity does a lot in increasing your self confidence. Every success that you get makes you more confident. Every failure that you face gives you reason to fight back even stronger and that definitely boosts your confidence.
Pressure Management: You are under a lot of pressure if you are involved with KIIT events. A lot. I have been in the situation and it cannot be described in words.
There are lot more attributes you keep on adding while being involved in co-curricular activities in KIIT.
Now you would be wondering what happened to my stance on this question.

Open your eyes. I have already answered your question.

The above mentioned attributes are a key factor that any interviewer looks in a candidate. So yes, co curricular activities and society helps only if you want them to help you. Get involved and develop these traits, you will surely succeed.
Just joining a society for the sake of getting placed won’t take you anywhere.",Event
How is the social life at KIIT?,"Pretty Much fun! The only constraint being the hostel entry timing for girls. Sadly, girls are allowed to stay out only till 7.30 in evening, which you may try extending to say 8 or even 8.30 if you are smart enough! Although it is deadly difficult for 1st yr students but gets slightly easy for 2nd and 3rd yr ones. While by the time you arrive in 4th yr, you know how to find ways around.

Hopping Back to your question,you might not seem to have as much glamorous hangout places as in cities like Delhi,Mumbai or Pune but trust me, the place is very cheap against all of these places with pretty much decent spots to chill around.

""KIIT Road"" as it is called so, is always full of mouth watering delicacies and junk food be it for small food joints or teeny food stalls or say food trucks stationed around especially during evenings! I will add a list of places in the end of this answer.
You get to participate in extra curricular activities and several events as such KIIT MUN, KIIT FEST, Nukkad Natak, Hostel Sports Event or DJ night on Diwali (Girls Hostel only! ), various Dancing and Singing events etc.
KIIT has a Student Activity Center responsible for monitoring numerous number of student governed societies be it KIIT E-Cell (Entrepreneurship Cell) , Korus(Singing Society), Kutumb, Kaash (Dramatics Society), Quotopia (Quizzing Society), Kronicle (Debating Society), Ensemble, Desire Foundation or RON. Believe me list is too long. Grab your Pick!
Summing up there is a hell lot to extract from, while in college. Gear up and keep exploring without letting it pass in vain!

I am putting forth name of some places as promised above :)

How is life at the KIIT campus?,"Life in KIIT is very happening. You won't realize how time passes here. I really enjoy whenever I am here with my friends. Everything is good here- from hostel to mess, classes, curricular activities, events and so on…

Classes and labs will keep you busy for few hours otherwise you will have lot of time for fun and self study.

There are many recreational clubs such as robotics,debate, painting,sports of various kind, dramatics, nukkad, theatre, modelling, designing, dance, NSS etc. You can get into maximum 5 clubs of your interest areas. There are also sports complexes which offers high class gym facilities and swimming pools. Basketball, tennis, volleyball courts are also there.

Hostel life is fun. Facilities are good and AC is also there. You also have different types of hostel depending upon which seater room you want such as- single seater, double and triple. You can choose a non AC or an AC room according to your convenience. Fees are according to the type of hostel room chosen and also with respect to the bathroom you have chosen such as common bathroom or an attached one.

There are many food courts and street shops near the campus where you can chill around with your friends and even alone. The best thing about this place it that, you can get very good quality and hygienic food at very low price.

KIIT is a place where you can find anything and everything you want. You don't have to go far away for small things. Places for amusement such as Khandagiri caves, Nicco park, water park are quite far but it's fun going out with friends for a short trip. Going to puri Beach is also very common among groups.

There are many more things that is best when experienced than just knowing about it. I can write on and on but I want to stop here as I've already written much!",Event

What is the procedure of pre-booking in a KIIT guest house?,"There are three ways one can book accomodation into the KIIT Guest house.

Directly reporting the guest house in Kathjodi campus. Asking for accomodation,if currently available and filling up form.
Calling on contact numbers provided in the KIIT website,most of the time left unanswered or busy. So drafting a mail would be a better way. When I was a student I mailed it to a staff member whose mail id was provided to me then. If you need that,can drop me a message.
If you’re a student there,you need to write an application to your hostel administration incharge stating them the reason and duration of stay and get it attested by him/her including photocopy of your ID card. I did that when my parents came to visit. Produce those documents at the reception and they would hand you the keys.
Am afraid the one day charge has been increased from 1000 to 2750 INR. KIIT has hiked the fees of almost everything since then :/",Housing
